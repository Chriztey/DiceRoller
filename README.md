Before you begin
In this codelab, you create an interactive Dice Roller app that lets users tap a Button composable to roll a dice. The outcome of the roll is shown with an Image composable on the screen.

You use Jetpack Compose with Kotlin to build your app layout and then write business logic to handle what happens when the Button composable is tapped.

Prerequisites
Ability to create and run a basic Compose app in Android Studio.
Familiarity with how to use the Text composable in an app.
Knowledge of how to extract text into a string resource to make it easier to translate your app and reuse strings.
Knowledge of Kotlin programming basics.

What you'll learn
How to add a Button composable to an Android app with Compose.
How to add behavior to a Button composable in an Android app with Compose.
How to open and modify the Activity code of an Android app.

What you'll build
An interactive Android app called Dice Roller that lets users roll a dice and shows them the result of the roll.

What you'll need
A computer with Android Studio installed.

Here's what the app look likes when you complete this codelab: https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-build-a-dice-roller-app/img/3e9a9f44c6c84634_960.png
